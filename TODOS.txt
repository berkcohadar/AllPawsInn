# TODOs
- In the payment section, Take payment does not work correctly. 
    It sometimes adds up instead of substraction. Find the problem there.

- In the payment section, when a customer is chosen and some services 
    are added to the list, the client is unchangeable until the payment 
    action is completed, even we remove the service.
    If clients.length > 1 and services.length == 0 => change client
    scenario: select a customer, add a service to the list, 
    remove this service, select another customer, try to add a service,
    error: clients are not the same.

- It is better to clean out some tables in the database. Tables are; 
    BookingObjects, Payments, Services Details. Also ClientDetails.AccountBalance should be set to 0.

- if mandatory, dont let customer send it blank. OR change it with space.

# TODOs
- In the payment section, Take payment does not work correctly. 
    It sometimes adds up instead of substraction. Find the problem there.

- In the payment section, when a customer is chosen and some services 
    are added to the list, the client is unchangeable until the payment 
    action is completed, even we remove the service.

- It is better to clean out some tables in the database. Tables are; 
    BookingObjects, Payments, Services Details. Also ClientDetails.AccountBalance should be set to 0.

# DONEs
- In Client info, "Notes" will be changed to "E-mail"

- On the Edit Client page, add a field to edit "Name", "Surname"

- Improve the UX in the payment section. Take payment button is broking the structure.

- Check-in button on the Daily Schedule page needs to be resized.

- In client info, there is no space between name & surname. Add it.

- On the reservation page, the "Remove Day" button does not work.

- On the weekly schedule page, dates are sometimes shown as "1/1/2000". 
    Find the reason and fix it. Note: when pushed "this week", dates return 
    to correct dates; however, the schedule is shifted right. It was monday-friday but shifted wed-sunday.
